## wallMode.py
Constructs a castle wall under the player as the player flies in creative mode.  It will clear a path through trees, mountains, and even other parts
the wall to build this wall.  The wall has a parapet with stone bricks and torches.  The algorithm isn't perfect but it works pretty well going in orthgonal lines with minimal elevation changes.  If you want to build a huge wall around your town, city, or castle, then this is a good place to start.
